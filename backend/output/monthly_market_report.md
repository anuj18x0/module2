### **Greater Vancouver Real Estate Market Analysis: November 2025**

### 1. Executive Summary

The Greater Vancouver housing market is settling into a distinct pattern as 2025 draws to a close, characterized by buyer patience and seller adjustments. November continued the trend of subdued sales activity, with 1,846 residential sales recorded—a 15.4% decrease from November 2024 and 20.6% below the 10-year seasonal average. This slowdown is occurring amidst a backdrop of plentiful housing supply. The total number of homes listed for sale surged to 15,149, a significant 36.3% above the 10-year average, providing buyers with the most extensive selection seen in years.

This imbalance is reflected in the sales-to-active listings ratio, which stands at a cool 12.6%. This metric places the market firmly in balanced territory, teetering on the edge of a buyer's market (historically defined as a ratio below 12%). This environment is creating downward pressure on prices, with the composite benchmark price for all residential properties now at $1,123,700, marking a 3.9% decrease year-over-year and a 0.3% dip from October 2025.

According to GVR’s chief economist, Andrew Lis, sellers are increasingly needing to "accept that pricing must reflect this new reality." Deals are being made when expectations align with the current, cooler market conditions, not the heated market of previous years. While detached homes are experiencing the most significant shift in favor of buyers (9.7% ratio), the townhouse segment is showing notable resilience, with its benchmark price seeing a slight month-over-month increase. As the typically quiet month of December approaches, all indicators point to a calm and steady conclusion to a year defined by market normalization and a re-balancing of power between buyers and sellers.

| Property Type | Benchmark Price | 1-Month Change | 3-Month Change | 6-Month Change | 1-Year Change |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Composite** | **$1,123,700** | **-0.3%** | -2.0% | -4.2% | -3.9% |
| **Detached** | **$1,900,600** | **-0.4%** | -2.0% | -4.2% | -4.3% |

### 3. Buyer Insights

This is a market of opportunity for well-prepared buyers.

*   **Abundant Choice:** With active listings 36.3% above the 10-year seasonal average, you have the most negotiating power and widest selection of homes seen in years. The pressure to make snap decisions has evaporated.
*   **Negotiating Power:** The overall sales-to-active listings ratio of 12.6% indicates a balanced market leaning in your favor. For detached homes, the ratio is just 9.7%, firmly in buyer's market territory. This means there is room for negotiation on price and terms.
*   **Price Softening:** Prices are down 3.9% from last year. This trend, coupled with motivated sellers, creates a favorable environment to make a purchase without the fear of overpaying in a bidding war.
*   **Strategy:** Be patient. Identify properties that have been on the market for several weeks. These sellers are more likely to be receptive to offers that reflect current market values. Use the benchmark price data to inform your offers.

### 4. Seller Insights

Success in this market requires a strategic and realistic approach.

*   **Price for Today's Market:** The primary takeaway from the report is that sellers must "adjust to market conditions not seen in years." Pricing your home based on sales from early 2022 or even last year will result in your property sitting. Use the latest month-over-month benchmark data as your guide.
*   **Understand Your Segment:** The market is not uniform. The detached segment (9.7% sales-to-active ratio) is the softest, requiring the most competitive pricing. The townhouse market (13.6% ratio and a slight price *increase* last month) is more resilient, indicating steady demand for this "missing middle" housing type.
*   **First Impressions Matter:** With over 15,000 active listings, your property must stand out. Professional staging, photography, and a compelling marketing plan are no longer optional—they are essential to attract the smaller pool of active buyers.
*   **Be Patient and Flexible:** Properties are taking longer to sell. Be prepared for a longer listing period and be open to negotiation on price, closing dates, and conditions to secure a deal.

### 5. Micro-Market Breakdown

While the overall region is cooling, specific sub-markets show unique trends:

*   **Resilient Pockets:**
    *   **Townhouses in Richmond:** Defied the regional trend with a strong **+2.0%** month-over-month benchmark price increase.
    *   **West Vancouver Detached:** Showed unexpected strength, with the benchmark price climbing **+1.0%** from October.
    *   **Port Coquitlam Detached:** Also saw a healthy **+0.7%** month-over-month price gain.

*   **Areas Facing Stronger Headwinds:**
    *   **Burnaby South Detached:** Experienced one of the sharpest monthly declines, with the benchmark price falling **-3.7%**.
    *   **Tsawwassen Detached:** Is down a notable **-9.3%** year-over-year, indicating a significant market correction in the area.
    *   **Burnaby South Apartments:** Also saw a significant monthly drop of **-1.6%**.

*   **Sales Activity Hotspots (by volume):**
    *   **Apartments:** Vancouver West (260 sales), Burnaby (134 sales), and Richmond (103 sales) led in transaction volume.
    *   **Detached:** Vancouver West (59 sales), North Vancouver (56 sales), and Burnaby (47 sales) were the most active detached markets.

### 6. Product Type Comparison

*   **Detached Homes:** Clearly a **buyer's market**. With a low 9.7% sales-to-active listings ratio and a benchmark price of $1,900,600 (down 0.4% MoM), buyers have significant leverage. Sales were down 13.6% compared to last November.
*   **Townhouses (Attached):** The **most resilient segment**. The sales-to-active ratio is a healthier 13.6%. Crucially, the benchmark price of $1,065,600 *increased* by 0.1% from October, suggesting demand for this housing type remains stable despite broader market cooling.
*   **Apartments:** Positioned in a **balanced market**. The 14.8% sales-to-active ratio is the highest of the three types, but still within balanced territory. The benchmark price of $714,300 saw a modest 0.2% monthly dip. This segment offers relative affordability and steady demand.

### 7. Inventory & Absorption Rate Analysis

The key to understanding the current market is the **sales-to-active listings ratio**, which acts as an absorption rate. At **12.6%**, the market is consuming just over one-eighth of the available inventory each month.

*   **Historical Context:** The report notes that downward price pressure occurs when this ratio dips below 12% for a sustained period. At 12.6%, we are hovering just above this critical threshold. This explains the slight price softening (-0.3% composite MoM) and the overall sentiment of a market favouring buyers.
*   **Impact of High Inventory:** The total active inventory of 15,149 homes is the engine driving this trend. This figure is 14.4% higher than last year and a massive 36.3% above the 10-year average. This supply glut means buyers are not rushed and can be selective, forcing sellers to compete on price and condition. The market has fully transitioned from the supply-starved conditions of recent years to one of abundant choice.

9.  "Economist Andrew Lis calls this a market with 'many buyers patiently waiting.' We can help you be one of the strategic ones who acts on this opportunity."
10. "With borrowing costs steady, the current market dynamic is driven by supply and sentiment. We are positioned for a **calm, stable end to 2025**."

    Key takeaways:

2.  **Subject: A Tale of Two Markets: Detached Homes vs. Townhouses in Vancouver**

    November's market report reveals a fascinating divergence between property types. While the detached home segment has moved into a buyer's market (9.7% sales-to-active ratio, -0.4% MoM price change), the townhouse segment is showing remarkable stability.

    - **Detached Homes:** Benchmark price at $1.9M. The low absorption rate gives buyers significant negotiation leverage.
    - **Townhouses:** Benchmark price at $1.06M. Prices *rose* 0.1% month-over-month, highlighting persistent demand for this typology, often referred to as the "missing middle."

    This data underscores that a one-size-fits-all analysis of the market is insufficient. Understanding the nuances of each segment is critical for advising clients on their next move, whether they are upsizing, downsizing, or entering the market. #MarketSegmentation #VancouverRealEstate #DataInsights #RealEstateInvesting #Townhouses #DetachedHomes
3.  **Subject: Navigating the Most Balanced Market in Years: Insights for Vancouver Buyers & Sellers**

    The November 2025 housing report from GVR paints a clear picture: balance has returned. With total inventory at a multi-year high (15,149 listings) and sales moderating, the frenetic pace of the past is over.

    **For Buyers:** This is a market of choice and opportunity. The current 12.6% sales-to-active listings ratio empowers you to negotiate from a position of strength.

    **For Sellers:** This is a market of strategy and realism. Overpricing is the biggest risk. Success hinges on a deep understanding of hyper-local comparable sales and current absorption rates.

    As we head into the quietest month of the year, the prevailing trends suggest a stable end to 2025. This provides an ideal window for planning and executing real estate goals for the new year. #RealEstateAdvisory #MarketUpdate #VancouverBC #BuyerTips #SellerTips

**Vancouver's Housing Market Finds Its Footing with a Calm and Balanced November**

The Greater Vancouver real estate market is closing out 2025 on a note of stability and normalization, a stark contrast to the volatile conditions of recent years. The latest data for November from Greater Vancouver REALTORS® (GVR) reveals a market characterized by patient buyers, adjusting sellers, and the most abundant housing supply seen in years.

In November, residential sales totaled 1,846, marking a 15.4% decrease from the same month last year and sitting 20.6% below the 10-year seasonal average. This deliberate pace is a direct result of the expanded choice available to prospective buyers. The total number of properties listed for sale on the MLS® system soared to 15,149. This figure is not only a 14.4% increase from November 2024 but also a remarkable 36.3% above the 10-year average, effectively ending the inventory shortage that previously defined the market.

This dynamic is creating a more level playing field. The sales-to-active listings ratio, a key indicator of market pressure, stood at 12.6% in November. This places the market firmly in "balanced" territory, just above the 12% threshold that typically signals a buyer's market. Consequently, prices are experiencing a gentle downward pressure. The composite benchmark price for all residential properties is now $1,123,700, a 3.9% decrease year-over-year and a modest 0.3% dip from October.

Andrew Lis, GVR's chief economist, aptly summarized the environment: "The data continues telling a story of a market with many buyers patiently waiting and sellers adjusting to market conditions not seen in years." He added, "Buyers and sellers are striking deals when their expectations are aligned and reflective of the current market – not the market of years ago."

While the detached home segment, with a 9.7% sales-to-active ratio, has shifted most clearly in favour of buyers, the townhouse market is showing notable resilience. The benchmark price for townhouses bucked the trend, posting a 0.1% month-over-month increase to $1,065,600, signaling sustained demand for this "missing middle" housing type.

As we enter the traditionally quiet holiday season, all signs point to a calm conclusion to the year. This period of stability offers a valuable opportunity for both buyers and sellers to assess their goals and plan a strategic, data-informed approach for 2026.

### 11. Investor Insights

The November 2025 report reveals a market ripe for strategic, long-term investors, not short-term flippers. The current cooling provides a rare opportunity for discounted entry points in a historically high-growth region.

*   **Long-Term Confidence:** Despite recent softening, the long-term data reaffirms the strength of Greater Vancouver real estate as a wealth-building asset. The 10-year price change for a composite property is **+34.4%**. For detached homes, it's **+34.7%**, and for apartments, it's a massive **+73.2%**. This illustrates that holding through market cycles delivers significant returns.

*   **Identifying Opportunity Zones:** The ideal investment is in an area that combines (1) recent price softening for a better entry point, and (2) proven, strong long-term growth.
    *   **Maple Ridge & Pitt Meadows:** These areas stand out. While benchmark prices have dipped 4.6% and 7.8% respectively over the past year, their 10-year growth is astronomical:
        *   Maple Ridge Detached: **+125.7%**
        *   Maple Ridge Townhouse: **+138.7%**
        *   Pitt Meadows Apartments: **+134.9%**
        The current dip could be an excellent entry point into markets with a proven track record of explosive long-term growth.
    *   **Port Coquitlam:** This market shows a similar pattern. Detached home prices are down 2.3% year-over-year but have an incredible **+94.8%** 10-year return. The apartment segment is even more compelling, down 4.0% year-over-year but up **+142.7%** over 10 years. The recent price dip combined with strong fundamental demand makes it a prime target.

*   **Product-Specific Opportunity:**
    *   **Townhouses:** With a 10-year return of **+94.0%** and the only segment to see a month-over-month price increase, townhouses represent the most stable asset class right now. They benefit from the affordability gap between condos and detached homes and are in high demand by young families. Areas like **Coquitlam (+112.5% 10-year gain)** and **Port Moody (+122.4% 10-year gain)** are top-tier townhouse investment locations.
